Easily perform A/B testing from within WordPress itself.

== Description ==
This [WordPress plugin](http://maxfoundry.com/plugins/) allows you to create A/B split test experiments using any page, with each experiment containing up to 3 variation pages. Metrics are automatically calculated in real-time, and your conversion pages can even be on a different website.

= Highlights =

* Works with any WordPress theme and any page can be used in the experiments
* Experiments consist of the original page, up to 3 variation pages, and a conversion page
* The conversion page can be on a completely different site/domain and still work
* Create an unlimited number of experiments, pause and re-start at any time
* Metrics are captured and calculated in real-time

Use the MaxA/B plugin to perform split tests on your [WordPress landing pages](http://maxfoundry.com/plugins/maxlanding/), [WordPress squeeze pages](http://maxfoundry.com/plugins/maxsqueeze/), and [WordPress sales pages](http://maxfoundry.com/plugins/maxsales/) so that you know which ones convert better.

= Notice =

The MaxA/B plugin currently only supports using pages as part of A/B experiments. Support for posts will come in a future release.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When should I stop my experiment? =

You should wait until the experiment has reached at least a 95% confidence level with statistically significant results, and ideally you should wait until the experiment reaches 99% confidence.

The higher the statistical confidence, the more likely the results will be statistically significant. For sites with high traffic, the time it takes for experiments to reach statistical significance will be much shorter than sites with lower traffic. Making decisions about your experiment results before the proper thresholds have been reached may result is false-positives that lead to lower-than-expected conversion rates.
